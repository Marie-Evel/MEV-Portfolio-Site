              StreetCred is a native app I developed as part of an online UX
              designer certification course I took at CareerFoundry between
              August 2019 and March 2020. The goal of this case study is to
              illustrate the UX design process from start to finish within
              the context of an app-building project.

              Peo­ple like to play games. Peo­ple like to play games on their
              phones. But peo­ple also want to play with their friends and
              spend more time out­doors. How about a so­cial <b>scav­enger

              I be­lieve that cre­at­ing an app that pro­vides ready-made
              scav­enger hunts with high-qual­ity con­tent, such as clever
              rid­dles, fun photo chal­lenges, and in­ter­est­ing his­tor­i­cal info,

          <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
          <p>
            Before jumping into mockups, wireframes, and user flows, it’s
            important to know our competitors, identify what they’re doing
            well, and learn from their weaknesses to improve our own product.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few popular scavenger hunt apps on the market, most
            of which create custom hunts for large groups or corporations (at
            a steep price). Others require users to create their own hunts.
            Very few apps offer ready-made hunts that can be played on demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve identified and analyzed two competitors who provide
            ready-to-play, affordable scavenger hunts:
            <span class="font-letsroam font-medium">Let’s Roam</span>, and
            <span class="font-uaq font-medium">Urban Adventure Quest</span> (UAQ). Let’s
            take a look at their strengths and weaknesses.

              (clever riddles, interesting historical info, fun photo
              challenges) that can be played anytime.</li>
            <li>Start with cities in the United States to test the concept
              locally. Then expand to popular travel destinations around the
              world.</li>
            <li>Partner with travel agencies and walking tour companies to
              develop hunts, and encourage contributions from locals in
              exchange for royalties or a commission.</li>
            <li>Provide a hunt demo that realistically mimics a hunt so users
              can get familiar with the game before paying for a hunt.</li>
            <li>To mitigate frustration when a hunt is not yet available in the
              desired city, offer free generic hunts (at the zoo or forest
              preserve, for instance) that are not city-specific. Generic hunts
              also allow users to test the app before purchasing a city-specific
              hunt.</li>

            Now that we have a good grasp on our competition, we need to
            understand our users. I decided to start with a survey to gather
            initial insights from a large sample of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The survey consisted of 23 questions (most of them multiple choice),

              <p>
                The sur­vey was great for gath­er­ing a large amount of
                <span class="font-blue"><b>quan­ti­ta­tive</b></span> in­for­ma­tion
                about our users. Let’s now turn to in­ter­views to gen­er­ate a

              </p>
              <h3>Research Goals</h3>
              <p>
                My re­search goals for the in­ter­views are sim­i­lar to the ones I
                had es­tab­lished for the sur­vey. With in­ter­views how­ever, I have
                the op­por­tu­nity to dig deeper on each topic. Here are ad­di­tional
                re­search goals that were not ad­dressed by the sur­vey:
              </p>
              <ul class="sc bullets med-blue-bullets">
                <li>Find out about people's experiences when traveling (good
                  and bad).</li>
                <li>Gather people's thoughts on guided tours and museums.</li>
                <li>Determine what people know / think about geocaching,
                  Pokémon Go, and escape the room games.</li>
                <li>Get suggestions for features and activities people would
                  like to have in an urban scavenger hunt game.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Interview Script</h3>
              <p>
                Rather than have a rigid script with spe­cific ques­tions, I
                pre­pared talk­ing points. That ap­proach worked well in keep­ing
                the in­ter­views con­ver­sa­tional and laid back.

              <h3>The Interviewees</h3>
              <p>
                I selected 5 interviewees with the following characteristics:
              </p>

                <li>2 single + 2 married with children + 1 married without
                  children.</li>
                <li>All enjoy traveling and have traveled more than once in the
                  past year.</li>
                <li>While not all of them have participated in a scavenger hunt
                  recently, I chose them because they seemed to be the type to enjoy that kind of activity.</li>

            It’s crucial to understand our users early in the design process.
            Let’s use the massive amount of info we collected in the research
            phase and convert it into UX design currency: user personas, mental
            journeys, and user flows.

          <h2>WHO ARE WE DESIGNING FOR?</h2>
          <p>
            Affin­ity map­ping al­lowed me to an­a­lyze the data col­lected from the
            survey and interviews, and de­rive im­por­tant in­sights from my
            par­tic­i­pants’ be­hav­iors, at­ti­tudes, goals, and frus­tra­tions. From
            there, I iden­ti­fied re­cur­ring themes and im­por­tant char­ac­ter­is­tics
            to cre­ate <b>user per­sonas</b>.

            From our research, we now have a bunch of ideas on features and
            screens to include in the app. Let’s contemplate navigation and
            hierarchy to determine how the various screens are connected.
          </p>
          <h2>NAVIGATION STRUCTURE</h2>
          <p>
            I want to keep the navigation as simple as possible to focus on the
            app’s two primary functions: <span class="sc font-red"><b>find a hunt
            </b></span> and <span class="sc font-red"><b>play a hunt</b></span>.
            Anything else not related to those, such as profile, settings, or
            FAQ, will be available from a kebab menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s an initial and very basic sitemap to illustrate the
            navigation structure I have in mind:

          To verify if I was on the right track with my initial sitemap, I
          conducted an open card sorting exercise on OptimalWorkshop.com.
          The participants were asked to group 30 topics related to my app’s

          The lesson here is that some of my cards were not clear and the
          participants were lacking context. For instance, one of the
          participants had a Create Hunt category, probably thinking users
          would be able to create their own hunts within the app (StreetCred
          provides already-made hunts only). Maybe a closed-card sort (with
          pre-defined categories) or an in-person card sort would have been
          more successful.

            I drew the first round of low-fidelity wireframes on mockup
            templates. Here’s a first attempt at the ‘My Hunts’ screen:

            Because there’s a grid, I was trying to align, distribute, and

            row the same height (8 dots per row).
          </p>
          <p>
            I counted the dots here too (14 for each half of the navigation

            ­­I pre­pared a us­abil­ity test plan to out­line the scope of the test­ing
            and iron out lo­gis­ti­cal de­tails in ad­vance of the ses­sions. Here’s
            what my plan in­cludes:
          </p>
          <ul class="sc bullets med-blue-bullets">
            <li>Test script</li>

          <h2>TEST OBJECTIVE</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of the testing was to measure StreetCred’s usability for
            first-time users by observing how the participants interact with
            the app when they first open it, and how they complete a few basic
            tasks.
          </p>
          <h2>THE PARTICIPANTS</h2>
          <p>
            I re­cruited 6 par­tic­i­pants from my per­sonal and pro­fes­sional net­work
            who gra­ciously ac­cepted to put my pro­to­type to the test.

          <p>
            When se­lect­ing the par­tic­i­pants, I made sure to cover a wide age
            range and in­clude var­i­ous personalities and back­grounds. One of the
            test sub­jects actually shared a lot of sim­i­lar­i­ties with Dereck.

          errors, pos­i­tive quotes, and neg­a­tive quotes to gen­er­ate a list of
          is­sues that I cat­e­go­rized as crit­i­cal, high, medium, or low pri­or­ity.
        </p>
        <p class="font-medium">
          While only one is­sue was crit­i­cal, I de­cided to also fix the rest of

          and pro­vide users with a more pleas­ant ex­pe­ri­ence, in­creas­ing the

          Accessibility is so much more than contrast and readability. For
          instance, rather than using color to <span class="sc font-blue"><b>

          <span class="sc font-blue"><b>complement</b></span> information.

            It was quite a journey to start with a problem to solve and end up
            with a scavenger hunt app that allows users to find hunts, read
            details about a hunt, bookmark a hunt, buy a hunt, invite other
            players to join in on the fun, split players into teams, and set
            preferences to obtain tailored recommendations.

              Once the func­tion­al­ity to play a hunt is developed, users need a
              way to ac­cess their pre­vi­ously played hunts so they can see
              pic­tures taken dur­ing the hunt, re­fer to the his­tor­i­cal

        <p>
          I thor­oughly en­joyed learn­ing about the many facets of the UX de­sign
          process while work­ing on this pro­ject. Now armed with hind­sight,
          there are a few things I will do dif­fer­ently in fu­ture pro­jects:
        </p>
        <ul class="sc bullets red-bullets">
          <li><p>Use <span class="sc font-red font-larger" style="font-weight: 600;">index cards</span> to sketch
            low-fidelity wireframes.</p></li>
          <li><p>Be mindful of <span class="sc font-red" style="font-size: 1.2em;">accessibility</span>
            early in the process.</p></li>
          <li><p>Develop a <span class="sc font-red"><b>design system</b></span>
            as soon as I start designing high-fidelity mockups.</p></li>
          <li><p>Despite my best efforts to put myself in the user's shoes,
            <span class="sc font-red" style="font-size: 2em;"><b>I am not the user.</b></span> That’s why
            it’s so important to get users involved as much as possible
            throughout the design process with the many tools and techniques
            at our disposal, such as surveys, interviews, card sorting,
            usability testing, preference tests, first-click test, etc.</p></li>
          <li><p>In future projects, I'd like to do more rounds of
            <span class="sc font-red font-medium" style="font-size: 1.2em;">usability testing</span>, and leverage
            tree-testing, preference tests and first-click tests.</p></li>
