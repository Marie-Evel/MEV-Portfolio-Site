              StreetCred is a native app I developed as part of an online UX
              designer certification course I took at CareerFoundry between
              August 2019 and March 2020. The goal of this case study is to
              illustrate the UX design process from start to finish within
              the context of an app-building project.

            <p class="sc">
              Peo­ple like to play games. Peo­ple like to play games on their
              phones. But peo­ple also want to play with their friends and
              spend more time out­doors. How about a so­cial <b>scav­enger
              hunt</b>?
            </p>
            <h2 class="sc">POTENTIAL SOLUTION</h2>
            <p class="sc">
              I be­lieve that cre­at­ing an app that pro­vides ready-made
              scav­enger hunts with high-qual­ity con­tent, such as clever
              rid­dles, fun photo chal­lenges, and in­ter­est­ing his­tor­i­cal info,
              will en­able users to dis­cover a new city ­­­­­while spend­ing time
              out­doors and shar­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence with their fam­ily and

            <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
            <p>
              Before jumping into mockups, wireframes, and user flows, it’s
              important to know our competitors, identify what they’re doing
              well, and learn from their weaknesses to improve our own product.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a few popular scavenger hunt apps on the market, most
              of which create custom hunts for large groups or corporations (at
              a steep price). Others require users to create their own hunts.
              Very few apps offer ready-made hunts that can be played on demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve identified and analyzed two competitors who provide
              ready-to-play, affordable scavenger hunts:
              <span class="font-letsroam">Let’s Roam</span>, and
              <span class="font-uaq">Urban Adventure Quest</span> (UAQ). Let’s
              take a look at their strengths and weaknesses.

            <li>Provide users with a memorable sightseeing experience by

              (clever riddles, interesting historical info, fun photo
              challenges) that can be played anytime.</li>
            <li>Start with cities in the United States to test the concept
              locally. Then expand to popular travel destinations around the
              world.</li>
            <li>Partner with travel agencies and walking tour companies to
              develop hunts, and encourage contributions from locals in
              exchange for royalties or a commission.</li>
            <li>Provide a hunt demo that realistically mimics a hunt so users
              can get familiar with the game before paying for a hunt.</li>
            <li>To mitigate frustration when a hunt is not yet available in the
              desired city, offer free generic hunts (at the zoo or forest
              preserve, for instance) that are not city-specific. Generic hunts
              also allow users to test the app before purchasing a city-specific
              hunt.</li>

              <h2>USER INTERVIEWS</h2>
              <p>
                The sur­vey was great for gath­er­ing a large amount of
                <span class="font-blue"><b>quan­ti­ta­tive</b></span> in­for­ma­tion
                about our users. Let’s now turn to in­ter­views to gen­er­ate a
                dif­fer­ent type of user data: <span class="font-blue"><b>
                qual­i­ta­tive</b></span> in­for­ma­tion.
              </p>
              <h3>Research Goals</h3>
              <p>
                My re­search goals for the in­ter­views are sim­i­lar to the ones I
                had es­tab­lished for the sur­vey. With in­ter­views how­ever, I have
                the op­por­tu­nity to dig deeper on each topic. Here are ad­di­tional
                re­search goals that were not ad­dressed by the sur­vey:
              </p>
              <ul class="bullets-med-blue">
                <li>Find out about people's experiences when traveling (good
                  and bad).</li>
                <li>Gather people's thoughts on guided tours and museums.</li>
                <li>Determine what people know / think about geocaching,
                  Pokémon Go, and escape the room games.</li>
                <li>Get suggestions for features and activities people would
                  like to have in an urban scavenger hunt game.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Interview Script</h3>
              <p>
                Rather than have a rigid script with spe­cific ques­tions, I
                pre­pared talk­ing points. That ap­proach worked well in keep­ing
                the in­ter­views con­ver­sa­tional and laid back.

              <h3>The Interviewees</h3>
              <p>
                I selected 5 interviewees with the following characteristics:

                <li>2 single + 2 married with children + 1 married without
                  children.</li>
                <li>All enjoy traveling and have traveled more than once in the
                  past year.</li>
                <li>While not all of them have participated in a scavenger hunt
                  recently, I chose them because they seemed to be the type to enjoy that kind of activity.</li>

        <p class="sc">
          Yes, the amount of data generated by the survey and interviews can be
          a little intimidating. But it turned out to be extremely valuable
          once I organized and categorized it, as it helped me to derive key
          insights for features to include in the app.
        </p>
        <ul class="sc bullets-red">
          <li>Feedback from the survey and interviews strongly supported
            including <span class="font-red"><b>riddles, picture challenges</b>
            </span> and <span class="font-red"><b>historical information</b>
            </span> in the hunts.</li>
          <li>All 5 interviewees mentioned that they would like the hunt to
            incorporate a mix of <span class="font-red"><b>famous landmarks</b>
            </span>, as well as little <span class="font-red"><b>hidden gems
            only known by the locals</b></span>.</li>
          <li>Most people think a scavenger hunt is a great way to explore a
            city while traveling. On the other hand, the idea of a
            <span class="font-red"><b>generic hunt or playing a hunt in their
            hometown was not very popular</b></span>.</li>
          <li>Very few people want to race during a scavenger hunt;
            <span class="font-red"><b>most prefer to take their time</b></span>
            and enjoy the sights.</li>
          <li>Most trav­el­ers want to try lo­cal cui­sine, and all in­ter­vie­wees
            said they would wel­come <span class="font-red"><b>restau­rant
